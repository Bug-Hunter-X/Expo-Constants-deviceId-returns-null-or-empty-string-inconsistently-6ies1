# Expo Constants.deviceId Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Expo.Constants.deviceId` inconsistently returns `null` or an empty string on certain devices or under specific conditions. This makes it unreliable for uniquely identifying users.

## Problem

The `Expo.Constants.deviceId` property, intended to provide a unique identifier for each device, occasionally returns `null` or an empty string. This behavior is unpredictable and can significantly impact applications that rely on it for user identification, data persistence, or other critical functions.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file showcases the issue. Run the project on different devices and observe the varying results of accessing `Expo.Constants.deviceId`.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a mitigation strategy that handles the potential `null` or empty string return value.  It provides a fallback mechanism to generate a UUID if `deviceId` is unavailable, providing a more reliable unique identifier for user tracking.
