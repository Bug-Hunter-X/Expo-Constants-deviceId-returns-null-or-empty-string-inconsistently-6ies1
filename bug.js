This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants module to access device-specific information.  The issue arises when attempting to access the `deviceId` property, which sometimes returns `null` or an empty string instead of a unique identifier. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the `deviceId` for user identification or data synchronization.
